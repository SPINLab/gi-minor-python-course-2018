# Chapter 2. Spatial data

In this chapter you'll learn how to read spatial data stored in a Shapefile, perform some basic calculcations and analysis, and store the results in a new Shapefile. 

## Assignment

You are asked to calculate the area, perimeter and geometry of the intersection between any geometry pair in `data/data.shp`.
   
![]()

## Steps

1. open `intersect.py`
2. follow the instructions (comments) and implement the asked functionality:
    1. to read a Shapefile that contains several overlapping features
    2. intersect one of the features  with the other features
    3. calculate the area and perimeter of the intersection
    4. store the intersection in a new Shapefile
3. run your code and compare your answers to the tutor's answers
