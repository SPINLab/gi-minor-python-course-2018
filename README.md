# GI Minor Python course

Dear GI Minor student, 

welcome to the Vrije Universiteit Python course. In this course we'll take a small dive into the Python programming language. **We'll cover some basics programming concepts and briefly delve into spatial analysis and data mining by way of scraping web pages.**

From previous iterations we've distilled that learning the basics isn't the a challenge (anymore) due to the abundance of MOOCs and interactive online tutorials. **Rather, the question is: how do I craft useful scripts that solve real-world problems?** 

Hence, we'll show you how to apply your knowledge to solve problems you run into in your studies, and give you tips-and-tricks on how to find help and expand Python's capabilities with external modules.
   
This course is extremely hands-on: we don't have slides or lecture notes; we'll only show and execute Python code. We think we can get away with this approach only because you'll have done the bulk of the learning by the time you join us on Monday morning. 

Curious? Read on!

## course overview

- introduction to Python
- introduction to debugging
- getting help: introduction to StackOverflow and online documentation 
- introduction to geospatial analysis with Shapely
- introduction to scraping with BeautifulSoup

## methodology and programme

The program is as follows: 

 - self-learning: Pytohn course on CodeAcademy
 - workshop I:
   - morning: interactive recap of CodeAcademy material, introduction to spatial analysis
   - afternoon: practical assignment - reading, analysing and writing spatial datasets 
 - workshop II: 
   - morning: recap of workshop I, introduction to scraping
   - practical assignment - scraping data from the web
