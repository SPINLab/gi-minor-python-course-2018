# GI Minor Python course

Dear GI Minor student, 

welcome to the Vrije Universiteit Python course. In this course we'll take a small dive into Python, perform basic spatial analysis and scrape a simple webpage.

In addition to teaching you the basics of Python, we'll show you how to apply your knowledge to real-world problems and give you tips-and-tricks on how to find help and expand Python's capabilities with external modules.
   
This course is extremely hands-on: we don't have slides or lecture notes; we'll only show and execute Python code. We think we can get away with this approach only because you'll have done the bulk of the learning by the time you join us on Monday morning. Curious? Read on!
